# LibGit2 Binding for Team Developer (SqlWindows)

This project provides a language binding for **LibGit2**, making it possible to integrate Git functionality into **Team Developer (TD)** applications, also known as **SqlWindows**. It enables TD developers to leverage the full power of Git directly from their TD projects.

## What is LibGit2?

**LibGit2** is a powerful, open-source library for interacting with Git repositories. It provides a C-based API for managing Git repositories, including features such as:

- **Cloning repositories**
- **Committing changes**
- **Creating and managing branches**
- **Merging branches**
- **Fetching and pulling from remotes**
- **Managing tags**

LibGit2 is used by popular Git clients such as **GitHub Desktop** and **GitLab**. It provides a lightweight and flexible way to work with Git in low-level environments or applications where command-line Git is not feasible.
More info on LibGit2 can be found here:

https://libgit2.org/

**LibGit2** is a standalone library that implements Git functionality in a C-based API, and it does not depend on an external Git installation. You can use LibGit2 in your applications without having Git installed on your system.

All Git operations (like cloning, committing, branching, etc.) are handled internally by LibGit2, so it provides the necessary functionality without requiring the Git command-line tool.

## What can this TD binding do?

This binding enables Team Developer applications to:

- **Initialize and open repositories** within your TD applications.
- **Clone remote repositories** to local directories.
- **Perform Git operations** such as committing, ~~pulling, pushing, branching, and more.~~
- **Work with Git references**, ~~branches, and tags programmatically.~~

(Strikethrough is work in progress)

## Supported TD versions

The library is for TD 5.1 and up (32bit).
For older ANSI versions, backport the library and replace all calls to SalGetBufferLength/SalSetBufferLength to SalStrGetBufferLength/SalStrSetBufferLength.

## Usage

To use this binding, simply include the provided **LibGit2TD.apl** library in your TD project. The following features are available:

- **Repository Management**: Create, open, and clone Git repositories.
- **Committing**: Create commits to save your changes in the Git history.
- (Work in progress) **Branching**: List, create, and switch between branches.
- (Work in progress) **Remote Operations**: Fetch, pull, and push changes to/from remotes.
- (Work in progress) **Tagging**: Create and list tags within a repository.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can clone a repository within your TD application using LibGit2TD:

Create an instance of class cfcLibGit2TDExt (local/global variable): uGit

```sqlwindows
cfcLibGit2TDExt: uGit
```

Call the available LibGit2 functions:

```sqlwindows
Set bOk = uGit.GIT_libgit2_init( nRet )
Set bOk = uGit.GIT_clone( "https://github.com/TD-Community/WinAPI_Declarations.git",
       "c:\\temp\\myrepo", nRepoPtr, nRet )
```

Here is an example to detect whether a folder is part of a Git repository:

```sqlwindows
Set bOk = uGit.GIT_repository_discover( "c:\\temp\\myrepo\\documents\\", sGitRootFolder, nRet )
```

When c:\temp\myrepo contains a Git repository the function gives back the Git root folder.

## Installation

1. Download and include the **LibGit2 binding** library **LibGit2TD.apl** in your TD project.
2. Ensure that you have the **LibGit2TD.dll** library available. Normally placed within the application runtime folder.
3. Start using Git commands within your TD environment.

## Requirements

- **Team Developer**: This binding is designed to be used within **Team Developer (SqlWindows)** version 5.1 and up.
- **LibGit2TD.apl**: Include library to be added to your projects.
- **LibGit2TD.dll**: You need to have this deployed with your application, as this binding interacts directly with the library.

(Git does not need to be installed)

## Test application

The LibGit2TD project contains a tester application which shows some examples how to use the API.

**LibGit2TD_Tester.apt**

As this project is work-in-progress, more tests will be added in future when more of LibGit2 features are exposed.


## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting issues or pull requests. We welcome enhancements, bug fixes, and feature requests.
More LibGit2 features need to be added to LibGit2TD and when you are able to pick those missing parts and implement them that would be great.
If you like to be an official contributor you can be added to this project.
