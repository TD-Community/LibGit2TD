# TD integration with Git

## What is LibGit2TD?

**Hooking** is a technique used in software development to intercept and modify the behavior of a function within an application at runtime. By using hooks, developers can inject custom code or logic into existing runtime behavior without modifying the original source code. This is particularly useful for:

- **Monitoring and logging**: Observing function calls and their data.
.

### Key Features:
- **.NET**: Implement alternative functions in c# instead of c++.
- **Easy API**: Provides intuitive methods to set up and manage hooks.
